This game is snake but slightly different. The player's objective is to get as many foods 
as possible within the time limit. However, when the snake eats food, +4 seconds is applied to
the clock. Also, in this game if you are going in a certain direction, you can immediately head
in the opposite direction (resulting in losing) to add more of a challenge.

The three concepts:

2D Array: the Grid that handles collision with Walls. Also helps visualize the grid.

Collections: Used a LinkedList to represent the snake and its body parts
and keep a list of foods on board.

Testing: Testing snake movement and collision in MainTest.java
